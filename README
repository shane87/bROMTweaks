bROMTweaks is an Android app designed for the Samsung Intercept.
It is specifically designed around b_randon14's custom Intercept ROM.
It will allow users to edit the tweaks exposed by the ROM, and allow
them to choose which tweaks to apply, and will also allow modification
of the values the tweaks use.
